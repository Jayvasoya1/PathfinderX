## 🎯 Key Features

- 🟢 **Drag to Move**: Reposition start and end nodes using drag-and-drop.
- 🧱 **Maze Building**: Draw walls interactively to create custom obstacle paths.
- 🚀 **Algorithm Selection**: Choose from various maze generation and pathfinding algorithms.
- ♻️ **Reset Grid**: Easily clear or reset the grid and start fresh.

## 🧠 Maze Generation Algorithms

- **Random Maze**
- **Recursive Division**
- **Vertical Division**
- **Horizontal Division**

## 🧭 Pathfinding Algorithms

- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** – Guaranteed shortest path
- **A\*** – Heuristic-based efficient pathfinding
- **Greedy Best-First Search** – Fast but not always optimal
- **Bidirectional Greedy Search** – Searches from both ends
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** – Explores level by level
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** – Explores deep before wide
- **Random Walk** – Purely random navigation
